# C# LeetCode Solutions

This project contains my own C# solutions to LeetCode problems.

For more information: <https://leetcode.com>

## Overview
Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repo. 
A few months ago I learned about LeetCode, and as it been a few years since I graduated University, I was curious to see how rusty the everyday developer life had made me to CS101 type problems. 

I decide to share my solutions with the community for those in need. It's not complete, far from it, and I promise to keep updating it as I go. 

I hope you find this useful, feel free to send your comments and feedback. 

Feel free to check out my personal website at <https://mattanm.com>, or follow me on Twitter <https://twitter.com/MattanGuitar>.

## Installation

### Requirements
This code base features a Visual Studio solution (2017). I set up a folder structure to enumerate the solutions so it would be easy to navigate. 

### Git access
To clone the code by command line:
* `cd your-workspace-folder`
* `git clone https://github.com/mattan212/LeetCode`
* `open your-workspace-folder`

### Run the project 
You can explore the solutions in three ways:
  * Using the test project and running via VS Test Explorer.
  * Creating a class, and calling it's main method in Program.cs.
  * Copy the solution into LeetCode code editer and run it there.

## Disclaimer
Currently the project is not full. It contains over 150 solutions for various problems, all in C#. 
I am aspring to update it frequently, depending on my availability and time constraints.  
These are my solutions and not anyone's else. There might be a better solution, and you should always explore and strive to achieving it yourself. More often that not, my solutions are at the top 90% of runtime for C#. 
The code here is for reference, education, and assistance to those of you out there that need it. 

Good luck, Mattan.
